# What is algebra?

* algebra is arithmetic that includes non-numerical entities like x:

	- 2x + 5  = 25 (one solution to x is 10)

# What is linear algebra?

* linear algebra only considers variables with linear relationships. Any number elevated to any potency is not linear algebra. The same for squared (or any other) root

* it is solving for unknowns within system of linear equations


	eq.1: d1 = 2.5t
	eq.2: d2 = 3(t-5)

            2.5t = 3(t-5)
            2.5t = 3t - 15
       2.5t - 3t = -15
               t = 30

* We can have ONLY one, none or infinite solutions in linear algebra, and nothing else (no 2 solutions, or 10 solutions, etc) -> it is impossible for lines to cross multiple times

* in a given system of equations :
	- Could be many equations
	- Could be many unknowns in each equation

# Origin of algebra

Al-Khwarizmi (c780-850) wrote The Compedious Book on Calculation by Completion (Arabic: "al-jabr") and Balancing

* 1900BC: Babylonian "rhetorical" algebra
* 1650 BC: Egyptian algebra
* 6th century BC: Indian mathematitians
* 400-300 BC: Greek "geometrical" algebra -> Euclides and Plato
* 250 BC: Chinese book on algebra
* Europeans:
  - 12th century: Arabic translations to latin
  - 13th century: rivaled others
* Contemporary applications:
  - Solving for unknowns in ML algorithms
  - Reducing dimensionality 
  - Ranking results
  - Recommenders
  - Natural language processing
